# Exercise 13.

# Many people do not use capital letters correctly, especially when typing on small devices like smart phones. In this exercise, you will write a function that capitalizes the appropriate characters in a string. A lowercase “i” should be replaced with an uppercase “I” if it is both preceded and followed by a space. The first character in the string should also be capitalized, as well as the first non-space character after a “.”, “!” or “?”. For example, if the function is provided with the string

# “what time do i have to be there? what’s the address?” 

# then it should return the string 

# “What time do I have to be there? What’s the address?”
# Include a main program that reads a string from the user, capitalizes it using your function, and displays the result.
