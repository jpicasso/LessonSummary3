Requests Lab
Welcome to the requests lab!

In this lab you'll work on the Udacity bookshelf practice application to build a Flask API that responds to GET, PATCH, POST and DELETE requests, handles pagination and request arguments.

You'll primarily be working in __init__.py in the /backend/flaskr folder, where you'll find detailed instructions marked @TODO as well as suggestions for how to TEST the application after writing each route.

To start the application, use the buttons below to start the frontend application in one terminal window.

In another terminal window run the below code once:


$ export FLASK_APP=flaskr
$ export FLASK_ENV=development

There is a setup script in the workspace directory. Open a terminal in this Workspace and run the script with:
$ bash setup.sh

The script installs the Python dependencies needed for this lab, starts the PostgreSQL service and executes the commands needed to set up the database. You should only need to run this script once.

Once setup is complete, navigate to the backend directory and start your Flask server with 

$flask run

Use the buttons below to manage the front end client server.
START FRONTEND APP SERVEROPEN APP IN A NEW TABSTOP FRONT END APP SERVER

When you have everything up and running, open the frontend application using the button above.

You'll notice that nothing works! The form is there, but none of the functionality is live.

From here, you can edit the __init__.py file in the backend directory to begin building out the necessary routes and logic to get the backend of your app up and running.
